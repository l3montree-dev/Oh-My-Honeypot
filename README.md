### 2. Login Attempt Capture
1. **SSH Honeypot**: Includes a fake SSH login feature that records usernames and passwords, ideal for understanding potential attack vectors.
``` bash
ssh localhost -p22
```
2. **PostgreSQL Honeypot**: Includes a fake PostgreSQL DB login feature that records usernames and passwords, ideal for understanding potential attack vectors. 
- Note: SSH authentication is not implemented; set `sslmode=disable`.
``` bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U admin -V 'sslmode=disable'
```

### 3. HTTP Request capture
1. **HTTP Honeypot**: Monitors the user agent, language preferences, and path in the HTTP request header.
2. **Spam Bot Honeypot**: A hidden contact form is implemented on the `/contact-us/` path. This form can only be filled out by bots, as it is not visible to humans. The email, name, and content can be recorded.

### 4. Vulnerable version configuration
- Some vulnerabilities can be configured in the honeypots using the `vuln-config.yaml` file. Currently, only the SSH version and HTTP response headers can be configured to return vulnerable versions to attract attackers. 

### 5. Persistent Storage in DB
1. **Storage of Basic Attack Data:** A base table named `attack_log` is created to store essential attack information, including attack ID, event time, port number, IP address, country, and attack type. The attack ID serves as a foreign key to link to other tables.
2. **Storage of Login Attempt Data:** A separate table named `login_attempt` is created to record login attempts for SSH and PostgreSQL services. This table includes the attack ID, service name (SSH or PostgreSQL), and the usernames and passwords used by the attacker.
3. **Storage of HTTP Request Headers:** A table named `http_request` is generated to capture HTTP requests. This table stores the attack ID, HTTP request method, and User-Agent. If an attacker sends an HTTP request via PUT or POST, the request body is saved in the Payload folder, with a maximum size of 100 MB. The associated HTTP body table contains the columns Content-Type and "Payload size". If the request is sent via a hidden contact form, the attacker's email address and name are stored in the `http_spam` table.

### 6. HTTP Endpoints
- Provides attack events details and statistics via HTTP endpoints on port `1112`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites


1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/l3montree-dev/oh-my-honeypot.git
```
2. Install Go, Docker & Docker-Compose
3. Install PostgreSQL in Docker
4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the access info to postgresql and set the honeypot name.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. You can run the honeypot by executing the following command:
```bash

go run main.go

```

6. There is even a Makefile included in the project, so you can simply run:
```bash

make

```
This starts the honeypot.


## Configuration

### Vulnerability on honeypot
Vulnerabilities of HTTP Honeypot and SSH can be configured as follows:
```yaml
http:
    headers:
        Server: "Apache/2.2.3 (Ubuntu)"
        X-Powered-By: "PHP/4.1.0"
ssh:
    ServerVersion: "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.8p2"
```
### DB-IP

The honeypot uses the [DB-IP](https://db-ip.com/) service to determine the geolocation of the IP addresses that interact with it. The db-ip lite database is included in the project and needs to be updated regularly. The link to download the latest version can be found [here](https://db-ip.com/db/download/ip-to-country-lite). The file needs to be extracted and placed in the `root` folder. The file name should be `dbip-country.csv`.
